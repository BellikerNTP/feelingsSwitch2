Zelda Switch 2,MrJustn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1ka0ll5/zelda_switch_2/,0,"Iirc, they’re the same price either way since you’re buying the switch 1 game and the upgrade. About the only way to “save” money is buying the Switch 1 version and getting the upgrade for free if you pay for the “expansion pack” tier of the Nintendo online.",Comentario,SolidStateVOM
Zelda Switch 2,MrJustn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1ka0ll5/zelda_switch_2/,0,"Cheapest route would be get pre-owned Switch 1 versions and buy any potential upgrades later.

If you want digital, its the same price point in the end for Switch 1 version + Upgrade or just buying the Switch 2 edition.",Comentario,StockHumor4768
Zelda Switch 2,MrJustn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1ka0ll5/zelda_switch_2/,0,"Kinda depends. 

If you have Nintendo Switch Online with the Expansion Pack, then you get the Zelda upgrades for free. If you don’t, each one is $10, so $20 altogether. 

It will be cheaper to go and find a used copy of each instead of paying full price for the Switch 2 editions.",Comentario,winkler01

You could get BOTW and TOTK digitally for $100 with vouchers.",Comentario,gaysaucemage

All Switch 2 Game Info,Howerev,https://i.redd.it/amqo0nj6olxe1.jpeg,36,Not at the moment no. Age of Calamity is currently not one of the games that is getting any type of switch 2 upgrade. But I imagine it will at least load faster due to the increased power of the switch 2,Comentario,Howerev
All Switch 2 Game Info,Howerev,https://i.redd.it/amqo0nj6olxe1.jpeg,36,They apparently added more to the switch 2 edition of BOTW then TOTK,Comentario,Howerev
All Switch 2 Game Info,Howerev,https://i.redd.it/amqo0nj6olxe1.jpeg,36,"That makes sense to me, TOTK was probably built with switch 2 in the back of their minds (at least). BOTW most likely needed some more love.",Comentario,TheBeardedBerry
All Switch 2 Game Info,Howerev,https://i.redd.it/amqo0nj6olxe1.jpeg,36,"Ah got it! I was worrying I had missed a niche fire emblem. 

I would assume there is a new fire emblem in the works for switch 2. People have been talking about a genealogy of the holy war remake, and 3 houses would benefit from a switch 2 edition.",Comentario,Hugh_Jegantlers

One thing that only time will tell is how prevalent “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” games will be. *Metroid Prime 4: Beyond* and *Pokémon Legends Z-A* are currently the only unreleased games with “Switch 2 Editions” announced, so we’ll have to see if that continues being a thing into 2026 and maybe beyond.",Comentario,Joshawott27

There is still plenty of money to be made and not every game needs to be on both Switch 1 and Switch 2.

So if anything some games will just be Switch 1 games and will be advertised that they work on Switch 2 since they're compatible.",Comentario,GrimmTrixX

Like Mario Kart World and DK Bonanza is only on Switch 2.  I'm guessing a lot of other new releases at the end of 2025 will also be switch 2.  They also want you to upgrade as they do make profit on the hardware.,Comentario,ShakeAndBakeThatCake

A console for 500 will stay for the next 6-8 years, games need to be bought during this time and that will add up very fast. If I would've bought 40 games for 60€ like they were during the Switch 1 era, I would've paid 2400€, with the Switch 2 they are at 3200€. That's an extra 800€. 

Even if I do have this money, it does not feel right and correct and that's what's throwing me and many other people off.",Comentario,N2-Ainz

Doom the dark ages won't get a switch 1 port. Rematch (soccer game from sifu Dev) might though.

Nintendo will probably have less, they will make it so more of their games will only have acceptable performance on switch 2 like DKBonanza. But I still think smaller games and indies will keep coming to switch at good pace for a couple years.",Comentario,thewoodulator

TOTK ran bad, but Violet/Scarlet was really shitty. Now I can finally play them stutter free and enjoy them, because I stopped playing them after all that stutter issue",Comentario,N2-Ainz
