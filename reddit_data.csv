MK Bundle no download code,Wet-Flatulence,https://nintendosoup.com/guide-how-to-download-your-copy-of-mario-kart-world-from-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-set/,5,"Kind of a bummer for me in the US.  I wanted MK physical & non-bundled system, but couldn't manage a pre-order for it, so I'm ""stuck"" with the bundle (1st world problems, I know). 

I had planned to buy MK anyway, and then hopefully resell the download code to a friend for the \~$50 price point in the bundle at some point. Womp womp.",Mikemgmve
