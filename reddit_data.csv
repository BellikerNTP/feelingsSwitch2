How would you rank these upcoming switch 2 games by anticipation?,Godofhammrs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9i17k,100,"Metroid Prime 4 is possibly my most anticipated extremely closely followed by Mario Kart World. DK and Age of Imprisonment are about equal following closely behind Mario Kart World. All 4 are day one purchases for me. Pok√©mon Legends Z-A I will get at some point but not all that hyped for it. Drag X Drive is one that I‚Äôm reserving judgement for. It looks intriguing, kind of has a Rocket League vibe, but I‚Äôm waiting to see if the game has any real content to it as well as waiting to see what price it is launching at. If it‚Äôs as bare bones as it looks and launches for more than $20 it‚Äôs a hard no for me.

How would you rank these upcoming switch 2 games by anticipation?,Godofhammrs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9i17k,100,"Of these six? 

Top one is Mario Kart World.  I'm really excited to try it out, and since it comes out day 1 I'm gonna be playing it before any of these other titles, so I'm anticipating it the most.  
  
Number two is probably Donkey Kong Bananza.  It's also coming soon and it looks super fun.  
  
Number three is Pok√©mon Legends Z-A.  I hope it's going to be at least about as good as the first Legends game, because if it is then I will love it.  
  
Number 4 is Metroid Prime 4.  I just finished playing through Metroid Prime 2 with my fianc√© this weekend.  We've been going through the series to get ready for it.  
  
Number 5 is Hyrule Warriors:  Age of Imprisonment.  Despite me absolutely loving the first two Hyrule Warriors games, Tears of the Kingdom really turned me off.  I don't like how it took basically nothing from Age of Calamity, and I just didn't have as much fun with it.  So a spin-off featuring characters I don't really care about in a story I don't really care about doesn't entice me much.  I don't need to get it at launch.  
  
Number 6 is Drag x Drive.  The gameplay looks like it could be fun, but the game has no characters and I don't see it having a lot of longevity with what I've seen.  Whatever price it comes out for will probably be too much.",MasterPeteDiddy

"Preordered Switch 2, never had Switch",ravagecat,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1k98xwz/preordered_switch_2_never_had_switch/,17,"Don't worry about memory expansion unless you are planning on getting several third party Switch 2 games right now. You can think about that later but even Switch 2 games made by Nintendo don't have that large of a memory storage issue.

If what you want is Switch games, I would recommend buying used games and looking for sales. Deku Deals is a great place to look.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is always a classic for good reason, it has DLC that expands the game but at full price it's $85 for both the base and DLC.

Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario 3D World, and Captain Toad Treasure Tracker have nice co op modes. The Mario + Rabbids games frequently go on sale and have solid gameplay, and I believe there is a multiplayer option for some gameplay in Kingdom Battle though I have only played it on single player.

If you're looking for variety that isn't Mario, I occasionally pick up and play Nintendo Switch Sports. If you've owned a Wii you're probably familiar with Wii Sports so you may enjoy something like that.

Also I would look into getting an NSO membership for the retro games because my nephews actually like playing those when they get the chance and some of them are multiplayer.

Most people will recommend the pro controller for best controller, but you should know that regular Switch controllers will work on a Switch 2 if you want to save because the older ones are cheaper. If you don't have an original Switch though you will need a charging dock for the regular Switch joycons.",PixieDustFairies

Only Lexar has the 1Tb micro SD EXPRESS card on the market, but other manufacturers will come out with theirs later on, which will also bring down the price of cards over time.

For Switch games, 1Tb in general is really overkill for the average person. Most people will be more than fine with 256-512GB cards.

remember when nintendo was THE value brand for families and average consumers?,Ok_Rain8345,https://i.redd.it/2b9zmdy41fxe1.png,0,"Wii was able to be inexpensive relative to the competition because instead of using contemporary hardware it was basically a beefed up GameCube. It maxed out at 480p over analog video while the competition was already in the HD era with 1080p HDMI output and played HD movies, and Wii didn't play DVDs because they didn't want to pay for the license. Let's also not forget that the Wii Remote retailed for $40 and a Nunchuk for $20, which adjusted for inflation is equivalent to $95 Joy-Cons. The $50 games would have been equal to $80 today as well. The ""Nintendo Selects"" line was great but that wasn't introduced until 5 years after launch and only 2 years before the Wii U would release. Overall, it sold very well to the non-hardcore gamer crowd, who didn't care that they were getting last generation tech with a new gimmick, but they also lost a ton of 3rd party support that generation due to how difficult it was to port multiplatform games due to the graphical limitations and awkward control schemes, which also lost them a lot of those hardcore gamers, who only would buy a Wii as a secondary console after the Xbox 360 or PS3, if at all.

Wii U famously was a flop so I wouldn't look there for inspiration. The deluxe model got a $50 price cut replacing the base model a month after launch from its original price tag of $350 ($480 today), still couldn't save it. 3DS was universally considered to be overpriced for a handheld at $250 ($350 today), and had to cut the price by $80 just 4 months after launch, which did help salvage that console from what was sure to become a failure. The 2DS line is what made it affordable.",4playerstart
remember when nintendo was THE value brand for families and average consumers?,Ok_Rain8345,https://i.redd.it/2b9zmdy41fxe1.png,0,"And we've finally gotten to the phase where people say ""Remember how much we loved the Wii, Wii u, and 2DS. We always loved them. You're just misremembering when Nintendo was the laughing stock of the gaming industry."" They had good games in-spite of the system. That's what people loved about them. Motion controls, and the screen gamepad were things basically only used well by a few games made by nintendo themselves. for everyone else, those aspects were either ignored, or shoehorned into games where they didn't belong, making them worse. The 2DS wedge was similarly ridiculed, and only used by little kids who break things and shouldn't use 3D, people without the money for a 3DS, and people who want to trade Pokemon to themselves. (if I remember correctly, it launched the same day as Pokemon X and Y)

You can't have already forgotten the Switch Lite. And you can't actually believe that they aren't planning to release another one eventually. And you can't seriously think that they should loudly broadcast when they're going to lower the price on anything. If they say ""It's $450 now, but in two years we'll be lowering it to $400"" how many people would go ""oh, I guess I'll just wait two years then.""

I'll give you credit for the games. It's a bit weird that they don't ever drop the prices even after years, but it's not like they're very old and outdated. As an example, there's no reason to play Madden 23 when Madden 24 comes out (I don't know sports games) so there's no reason to keep selling 23 at the same price. But Nintendo games are famously evergreen to the point where they're by far the company that people emulate games from the most, and it's not even close.",Redpyrobyte

I want to sell it. It has some scratches and a small mark on the ridge (minor cosmetic imperfections), but runs perfectly fine. Don't know exactly how much to sell it for, so I was going to pre order the Switch 2 in person at Gamestop and trade mine in, but we don't have the trade in offers in Canada at the moment, so I just kept my Walmart preorder instead. Will try selling mine on Kijiji or something for a competitive price in my area since I want the money ASAP. Just don't know how much to sell it for. The trade in value for the V1 at Gamestop in the US is equal to around 160 - 170 CAD. Hoping I can MAYBE get 180 or 190 CAD if I sell on Facebook or Kijiji.",UserOnForums
Anyone else trade in their Switch?,Joventer567,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1k99aiw/anyone_else_trade_in_their_switch/,70,"Yeah, they gave me $133 for my V1 Switch.  $125 plus 10% of their normal trade-in price.  They spent 30 seconds looking at it and didn‚Äôt notice the Joycon Drift.  I haven‚Äôt played that in a year and a half, because that‚Äôs when I got the OLED, which is my main Switch.  Although, once I get the Switch 2, I probably won‚Äôt play the OLED anymore, so I might sell that in a few months too, or maybe I‚Äôll keep it idk.  I got the Mario Kart World bundle btw.",DifficultyOk5719

Since switch 2 is as pricey as it is, I don‚Äôt want to take it places too often so thinking my oled switch will end up being my travel console and switch 2 will be more of a home console. I try not to sell hardware, though I did part with my ps4 pro when I got the 5, and my V1 switch when I got an oled. But yeah, probably not but we‚Äôll see",Jimmythedad
Anyone else trade in their Switch?,Joventer567,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1k99aiw/anyone_else_trade_in_their_switch/,70,"I was able to trade in a gray Switch Lite I got for $60 on OfferUp and then got $106 for it. So there‚Äôs a $46 profit right there. Then I got a Switch OLED for $180 from OfferUp, but instead of trading it in to get $192.50 since I have a 10% increase being a Pro member, I sold it for $220 on OfferUp. I‚Äôve profited around $86. 

I could still trade in my turquoise Switch Lite to get another $106 or $110 since it has the box and charger, but there‚Äôs a limit trading in the same devices at GameStop. Your account could be flagged for it. You can‚Äôt abuse the promo. But I decided not to sell my Lite because I would eventually miss that size seeing that the Switch 2 is a little larger than the Switch OLED. 

Who knows how small the Switch 2 Lite will be? We saw there wasn‚Äôt much of a size difference between the PS5 and PS5 slims. And what if the 2 Lite is $350? I‚Äôve seen price hikes for unreleased PC handhelds. Makes me think that I may not get a Steam Deck 2 because it could be $600. That $400 feels like a one-time thing. We may never see a Deck sold for that low ever again if prices keeps going up for all of them.

There‚Äôs a chance I will sub to Nintendo Online again for $20 per year because I need my cloud saves. Will cloud save some of my games. Then when my Switch 2 arrives, I will download all the saves. Don‚Äôt want to start over my Switch 1 games again. This usually what happens when you have multiple Switches but no cloud saves. Back to a clean slate.",PercentageRoutine310

Answered question about Switch 2,Grand-Ad-5029,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1k97xmk/answered_question_about_switch_2/,12,"- it will be possible to port AAA games released on PS5 and XBOX series S/X, but unlikely not for PS6 and next gen XBOX
- the battery life will be roughly the same. They prioritized increasing power than increasing battery life
- MicroSD Express Card price is not decided by Nintendo, but the demand has already gone up so we might get cheaper revisions later
- the Switch 2 creators have already mention that they have implemented measures to reduce the chance of stick drift occurring¬†
- the prices are at the level Nintendo can get away with selling them at",DevouredSource
